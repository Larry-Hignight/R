## TODO

- Papa smurf page and images
- Overdose deaths from opiates
- Overdose death increase from fentynal
- page on "is the reduction in homelessness due to overdoses"
- review of causality
- is the affordability issue in LA due to the sanctuary city status?
- Look into scraping this data table (https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/heroin.html)

## Reason

1. Demonstrate the use of R, RStudio and RMarkdown
2. I feel that it is important for all of use to questions our assumptions using the latest data
- (otherwise, you inevitably come to the conclusion that all Smurfs are Evil based on the rascally Papa Smurf)
- TODO Papa Smurf image
3. I feel that it is incumbent on the older, most experienced, members of the LUG to help mold the younger or less experienced by presenting relevant information to the group.
4. Phill's work problem is quite interesting
5. Stay sharp

## Heroin Overdose Rates

## Heroin Overdose Rates (June 2017)

[Drug Deaths in America Are Rising Faster Than Ever]
(https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html)


## Heroin Overdose Rates

[CDC Heroin Overdose Data](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/heroin.html)

According to the CDC Heroin Usage has Increased:
- In 2015, around 828,000 persons in the United States (12 years or older) used heroin in the past year (~0.3 per 100 persons)
- In 2014, more than 11,000 hospitalizations occurred for unintentional, heroin-related poisonings
Heroin-Related Overdose Deaths

*As heroin use has increased, so have heroin-related overdose deaths:*

- Heroin-related overdose deaths increased fivefold from 2010 to 2016.
- From 2015 to 2016, heroin overdose death rates increased by 19.5%, with nearly 15,500 people dying in 2016.
- Among people presenting for treatment for addiction to opioids, and who initiated use of an opioid in 2015, about two out of three started with prescription opioids


## Overdoses Amongst the Homeless

[Mortality Among Homeless Adults in Boston](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1556797#qundefined)

- A total of 28 033 adults were followed for a median of 3.3 years, yielding 90 450 person-years of observation. The mean age at cohort entry was 41 years (Table 1). I
- Drug overdose was the leading cause of death, accounting for 16.8% of all deaths in the cohort (Table 2). Opioids were implicated in 81% of overdose deaths;

Contrasted with an earlier study:

- Hwang et al7 analyzed data on 17 292 adults seen at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) in 1988 to 1993. This study documented the substantial toll of human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection, which was the leading cause of death among 25- to 44-year-olds and accounted for 18% of all deaths in the study cohort.


## Overdoses Amongst the Homeless

[Characteristics of Homeless Adults Who Died of Drug Overdose: A Retrospective Record Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911892/)

- In a study of 28,033 adults seen at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) in 2003â€“2008, _drug overdose caused one in three deaths among those under the age of 45 years, a death rate 16 to 24 times higher than in the Massachusetts general population_
- In our study, a large percentage of overdose deaths involved multiple substances and about one-third involved alcohol intoxication
- _Nearly two-thirds of overdose decedents having a documented history of problem alcohol use_

Note - This study builds on the analysis from the previous study and is available from the website
